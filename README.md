## Producer MarketPlace

In this project I created a marketplace where music producers can sell their work. Customers will be able to have direct contact with the seller and vice versa.  

### Motivation
Before coming to FlatIron I used to use the program FL studio to produce music. It was more of a hobby and mostly done on free time but, there was a point in time where I considered taking it more serious and turning that hobby into a career. To be able to sell your work people need to know who you are, nobody just goes around buying anything from people with little to no credibility. The purpose of my project was to give those with small support groups a place to grow and put their work out into the open without being shadowed by people with giant established bases. 

### npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
